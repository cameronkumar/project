Scrolling the scroll wheel while an object is selected enters "selection mode". You may use this mode to scroll through all spheres on the screen and press the right mouse button to select an object. The escape key will exit scroll mode without selecting an object

Right mouse button will spawn a context menu, where information about intersections can be output to the console or the intersections themselves can be drawn on screen for individual or all objects. Object's colour or transparency properties can also be changed from this menu. Slideshow mode can be entered from here also, where users can display objects of a specified key value one at a time or in pairs. Slideshow mode may either transition to the next slide either when the space bar is pressed or after 10 seconds, depending on which option the user requests. Hitting the escape key while in keypress mode will exit slideshow mode. There is also a "help" feature that will print this information to the console when selected.

For further help see the user manual.
